Let's recreate the Kontis paper
Run the counterfactual

Load in the data
For this, we keep the time component, but we ignore the spatial component

Plot the 5 year average
Discuss why 5 year average isn't the best, and why we might want a probabilistic model

Start building some time series models

Train the models 2015-18, forecast 2019
Check convergence etc
Pick the best model based on validation

Train the best model 2015-19, fit 2020
Calculate excess deaths and error

Discuss (Bayesian) model averaging and covariates as an extension
