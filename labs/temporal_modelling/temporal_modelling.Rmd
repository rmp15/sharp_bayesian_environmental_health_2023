Explain the context of these studies
Kontis covid paper: run the counterfactual
Aim of practical is to train a model up to Feb 2020 and predict from the start of the pandemic

Either aggregate data to national level or pick a single region

Load in the data and plot

## Simple model with slope only (linear regression)

## Linear regression with covariate (e.g. temperature)

## Model with slope and AR terms

Focus on the process of fitting models convergence etc

Train the best model 2015-19, fit 2020
Calculate excess deaths and error
Pick the best model based on validation

Discuss (Bayesian) model averaging as an extension
