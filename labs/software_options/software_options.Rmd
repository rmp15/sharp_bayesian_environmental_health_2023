This is just a placeholder.
I think this should be an open hour to *explore*.
Keep it free
The students should:

- pick any of the PPLs we discussed
- try and install it (we can help)
- build a model (we will pick which one for consistency)
- check against the nimble output and our solution

Instructs can say at the beginning who is helping for what, e.g.
Robbie (INLA)
Liza (Stan, Turing.jl)
Theo (PyMC, numpyro)
Gary (INLA, WinBUGS - it's the same as nimble)

The solutions will be in the folder `labs/software_options/solutions`
